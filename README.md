# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python program lets you perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two numbers you input. It’s designed to be fun, easy, and a little bit quirky! 😎

## Features
- Handles decimal numbers using `float()`.
- Calculates:
  - Sum ➕
  - Difference ➖
  - Product ✖️
  - Quotient ➗

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The program will calculate and display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers you entered.

## Example

Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25

## Notes
- Make sure you don’t enter zero as the second number to avoid division by zero errors! The program currently assumes responsible input. 😅
- The program supports decimal numbers thanks to Python’s `float()` function.

## Code Highlights
- Uses clear, step-by-step comments to explain each part.
- Fun and friendly prompts and print statements to keep things engaging.

## License
Feel free to use and modify this code for your own fun projects! No restrictions here—go wild with math! 🎉

Enjoy calculating like a boss! 😎✨
If you'd like, I can also help you add error handling for division by zero or other improvements!
